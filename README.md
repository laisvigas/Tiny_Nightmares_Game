## About This Project

This game was developed for the **Object-Oriented Programming** subject for the course **Software Developer** taught by **Professor Vitor Santos** at **Casae Digital**.

**Tiny Nightmares** is heavily inspired by the atmosphere and themes of *Little Nightmares*, a game I deeply admire for its storytelling, eerie environments, and emotional undertones. I wanted to bring a bit of that dark, mysterious world into a text-based RPG format, using Java and core object-oriented principles such as **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, and **polymorphism**.
